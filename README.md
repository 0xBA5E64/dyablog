# dyablog
*[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) + Blog = `dyablog`*

An inconsequential blog built on Django, vaguely following the instructions of a soon to be four year old [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/F5mRW0jo-U4?t=11258).

This project is mainly personal practice fo proper Python project management, making use of pyenv and Poetry following in the footsteps of my earlier, dependency-free, largely version-agnostic [`sudoku-solver`](https://github.com/0xBA5E64/Sudoku-Solver) project.

## Requirements
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) Python version manager
  - Python 3.10.7
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package & dependency manager

## __HEAVILY__ WORK IN PROGRESS
